ledmsg
======

Linux program for writing text messages into *B1236*, *B1248*, and compatible
led matrix screens.

This is a port of ajesler/ledbadge-rb to C, because I didn't want to install
Ruby or Perl on my embedded boxes.

Fancy features such as images, snow, pictograms are not supported. Text only,
speeds only.
